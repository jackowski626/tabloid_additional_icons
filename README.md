# Tabloid Additional Icons
Additional icons for the Android icon pack "Tabloid" (discontinued now).
You can add them manually via launchers that support this feature or integrate them to Tabloid / other icon pack.
Creating these icons isn't too hard easy. Take an existing tabloid icon, copy it's shape, change the color, add an icon and, for the final touch, a light shadow of the icon on the shape. You can try desaturating the colors of the icon/background for a better effect.
